        Occasionally, we will also add other anime that have many episodes in this list because they take time to get completed before release. (Bleach, Hunter x Hunter, etc)</p>

        The audio for the clips will usually be in Japanese or in English.
        Please also keep in mind that some of our clips were cut back in 2017 and some of them may not have audio.</p>
    <h1>There are no clips on the anime page?</h1>
    <p>If you only see the animeclips.online logo when you’re on the anime page, it means that the clips didn’t load properly. Simply click on the refresh button on the right to have them load again.</p>
    <h1>When do you release new anime clips?</h1>
    <p>We try to release a few anime per month when possible. Sometimes, we have other priorities and it makes it harder for us to be on time. Our team is currently very small so we can only do as much with the few of us. If you do not see an anime featured on our website then it means that it is not currently available from us or has yet to be released. Planned anime will be advertised with “Coming Soon” and be visible on the website’s clips page.</p>
    <h1>Does animeclips.online have a mobile app?</h1>
    <p>We currently do not have an app for mobile users but it is on our list of projects in the near future once we reach our monthly goals.
        For now, we will try our best to make the browsing experience smoother for mobile users.</p>
    <h1>How do you encode (render) the anime clips?</h1>
    <p>When it comes to the encoding of the clips, we follow a very forward process which starts with acquiring the anime episode or movie in question in it’s original format when possible. The format we usually look for are in .mkv, we then make sure that it’s a good quality source before proceeding to cut it into clips. Once we’ve confirmed the quality, the anime is cut in section and rendered out in .avi which are then encoded in .mp4 for the final delivery. We limit our compression to 15-20 Mbps in order to keep the file somewhat relatively small while also keeping most of the quality.
        You may notice some pixels tears or artifacts in some of our older clips due to our older method but also due to the nature of the anime clip itself where 15 Mbps may not always be enough to display a good quality anime clip. Most of those issues have however been fixed and in some cases the anime was updated with new cuts.
        If you have an issue with some of the clips or notice some pixel tearing, please contact us.</p>
    <h1>I get the error Network Failed after downloading a folder?</h1>
    <p>Unfortunately, this issue is usually out of our control and may be related to your connection or to our video hosting server. The quick fix for this problem would be to only download a few clips at a time instead of a folder which will make it less likely for you to have corrupted files. We also only recommend that you download a batch of folders if you have fast internet (preferably cable internet rather than wifi).
        If it still doesn’t work, make sure your vpn isn’t limiting your network access if you are using one. You can also become a Patreon member and get access to our backup Google Drive.</p>
